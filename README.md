# VibeHero - Your AI Agent's Project Manager

**Transform AI agents from occasional helpers into reliable, autonomous team members through structured project management.**

**Privacy-First:** Your code never leaves your system. Your API keys stay yours. We only facilitate the management layer - no code access, no data mining.

Hosted on Vercel with PostgreSQL - no sketchy infrastructure, just boring, reliable services.

**Stop babysitting AI agents with constant manual prompting.** Create tasks when inspiration strikes, then walk away while AI agents work through backlogs systematically. SEAMLESS GITHUB ACTION FLOW WITH CLAUDE - kick off Claude to work on PR's with button click from VibeHero.

## How it works
- **True Delegation, Not Micromanagement:** Queue up work ideas anywhere, let AI agents process systematically
- **AI-Native Project Management:** Built for hybrid human-AI teams working on the same task boards
- **Privacy-First Management Layer:** We coordinate without accessing your code, data, or repositories
- **Scaling "Vibe Coding":** Structure spontaneous coding ideas while maintaining creative flow
- **Dogfooded Platform:** Every feature built using VibeHero itself - from chaotic late-night coding to structured progress

- AI development workflows are chaotic and unstructured

- Lack of systematic delegation to AI agents
