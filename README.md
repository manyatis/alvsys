# MemoLab

**Your code never leaves your system. Your API keys stay yours.**

Hosted on Vercel with Supabase (PostgreSQL) - no sketchy infrastructure, just boring, reliable services.

Give your AI agents memory. Turn GitHub issues into vectorized memory banks that make AI smarter over time, not dumber as projects grow.

## How it works
- You run your own AI agent locally
- Connect it to MemoLab via API 
- We never see your code or API keys
- Agent autonomously works through your issue board

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Add your keys
4. `npm install && npm run dev`
5. Or use hosted version: [memolab.io](https://memolab.io)
