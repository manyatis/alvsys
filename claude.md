# VibeSight - AI Native Agile Board

## Project Description

VibeSight is an AI-native agile board designed for AI agents like Claude Code to collaborate with human developers. It provides a Jira-style kanban board where humans can monitor, review, and control AI work through structured task cards. The core of the app is a set of API endpoints that AI agents interact with to onboard, receive instructions, update task status, and add progress comments.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### API Infrastructure
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google, GitHub, Apple OAuth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Session Management**: Database sessions with Prisma adapter

#### Core API Endpoints
- **AI Onboarding**: `GET /api/[project]/ai/OnboardAgent` - Provides comprehensive AI agent instructions
- **Card Management**: Full CRUD operations for cards with project-specific access
- **AI Card Operations**: 
  - `next_ready` - Get highest priority READY task
  - `update_status` - Update card status with optional comments
  - `get_card_details` - Get detailed card information
- **Project Management**: Create/read projects and organizations
- **Activity Logging**: All AI API calls logged to AIWorkLog table

#### User Interface
- **Landing Page**: Modern design with authentication
- **Navigation**: Responsive navbar with user dropdown, dark mode support
- **Projects Page**: List all user projects, create new projects/organizations
- **Kanban Board**: Jira-style board with 6 status columns
  - Refinement, To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Review, Done
  - Collapsible sidebar with board actions
  - Professional card design with priority indicators
  - AI-allowed task badges
  - User avatars and assignee indicators

#### Design System
- **Dark Mode**: Complete theme support throughout
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with proper breakpoints
- **Professional Styling**: Rounded corners, smooth transitions, proper spacing
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus states, keyboard navigation

### üîß Technical Architecture

#### Database Schema (Prisma)
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant organization structure
- **Projects**: Project ownership and user access control
- **Cards**: Task cards with priority, status, AI permissions
- **Comments**: Task comments from humans and AI agents
- **Agent Developer Instructions**: Structured AI work instructions
- **AI Work Log**: Activity tracking for all AI operations
- **Users**: Authentication and subscription management

#### AI Agent Integration
- **Onboarding Flow**: AI agents receive comprehensive instructions via API
- **Task Assignment**: Priority-based task selection with `next_ready` endpoint
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status changes with comment logging
- **Progress Tracking**: All AI activity logged for human oversight

### üìã Current Card Schema

#### Core Fields
- **Priority**: Integer (1=highest, 5=lowest) with visual indicators
- **Status**: Enum (REFINEMENT, READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, READY_FOR_REVIEW, COMPLETED)
- **Title**: Required summary text
- **Description**: Optional detailed description
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Optional completion requirements
- **isAiAllowedTask**: Boolean flag for AI agent permissions
- **Comments**: Related comments from humans and AI agents

#### Agent Developer Instructions
- **Type**: GIT, SPIKE, CODING, ARCHITECTURE
- **Branch Management**: Branch naming and creation flags
- **Research Prompts**: Web and code research instructions
- **Architecture Guidelines**: System design considerations
- **General Instructions**: Flexible instruction field

### üéØ AI Agent Workflow

1. **Onboarding**: Agent calls onboarding endpoint to receive instructions
2. **Task Selection**: Agent calls `next_ready` to get highest priority task
3. **Work Initiation**: Agent updates status to IN_PROGRESS with comment
4. **Progress Updates**: Agent adds comments during work
5. **Completion**: Agent updates to READY_FOR_REVIEW when done
6. **Blocking**: Agent updates to BLOCKED if assistance needed

### üöÄ Next Development Priorities

#### API Enhancements
- **Card Drag & Drop**: Real-time status updates via API
- **User Assignment**: Assign specific users to cards
- **Card Comments API**: Full comment CRUD operations
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-card status updates
- **Webhooks**: External system notifications

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Card Details Modal**: Expandable card view with full information
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for live board updates
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by assignee, priority, AI status
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across cards
- **Activity Timeline**: Visual history of card changes

#### AI Agent Features
- **Card Assignment**: Specific agent assignment to cards
- **Progress Estimation**: Time estimates and progress tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting and recovery
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Agent collaboration on complex tasks

### üìù Development Notes
